Templating made easy.

This is a lightweight library that'll help you if you quickly want to setup some view or template, your imagination si the limit.

You can use it like we often se on the MVC structured frameworks, to quickly input some data on a XML file or any other kind.

# How to install via Composer

The recommended way to install is through [Composer](http://composer.org).

```sh
# Install Composer
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Add Template as a dependency
$ php composer.phar require masnathan/template:dev-master
```

Once it's installed, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
